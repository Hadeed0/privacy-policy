        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> [Date]</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Subtitle Learner ("we," "us," or "our") operates Subtitle Learner, which uses WebView to load YouTube and Google Translate. Additionally, our app utilizes speech recognition to convert user speech into text for translation purposes in Google Translate WebView. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring your personal information is handled securely and responsibly. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <h3>1.1 Personal Information</h3>
        <p><strong>Speech Data:</strong> Our app collects audio data when you use the speech recognition feature. This data is converted into text and used for translation purposes within the app.</p>

        <h3>1.2 Automatically Collected Information</h3>
        <p><strong>Crash Reports:</strong> We collect crash logs to help us improve the app and fix any issues.</p>

        <h3>1.3 Future Data Collection</h3>
        <p>We do not currently collect any additional personal data. However, we may decide to collect additional types of data in the future. If we do, we will update this Privacy Policy accordingly to reflect those changes.</p>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Provide and improve our services, including speech recognition and translation features.</li>
            <li>Monitor and analyze usage and trends to improve the app's functionality and user experience.</li>
            <li>Ensure the security of our services and prevent fraud.</li>
            <li>Generate revenue through ads displayed in the app.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. How We Share Your Information</h2>
        <h3>3.1 Third-Party Services</h3>
        <p><strong>Google Translate:</strong> We use Google Translate for translation services. The text generated from speech recognition is sent to Google Translate to provide translations.</p>
        <p><strong>YouTube:</strong> Our app loads YouTube videos through WebView. YouTube may collect data as described in their privacy policy.</p>
        <p><strong>Advertising Partners:</strong> We share information with our advertising partners to display ads in the app. These partners may collect data such as device information, location data, and app usage data to serve targeted ads and improve their ad campaigns. The data collected by our advertising partners is subject to their own privacy policies.</p>

        <h3>3.2 Legal Requirements</h3>
        <p>We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</p>

        <h3>3.3 Business Transfers</h3>
        <p>We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.</p>

        <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information against unauthorized access, loss, or destruction. However, no security system is impenetrable, and we cannot guarantee the security of our systems 100%.</p>

        <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>We will retain your personal information only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it, or, if this is not possible, we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

        <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our app is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under 13, we will take steps to delete such information promptly.</p>

        <h2>7. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
        <p>If we begin collecting additional types of personal data in the future, you will have the following rights:</p>
        <h3>7.1 Access and Update</h3>
        <p>You have the right to access and update your personal information at any time through the app settings or by contacting us.</p>

        <h3>7.2 Opt-Out</h3>
        <p>You can opt-out of data collection by discontinuing the use of our app and uninstalling it from your device.</p>

        <p>You have the right to request a copy of your personal information in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format.</p>

        <h3>7.4 Deletion</h3>
        <p>You have the right to request that we delete your personal information, subject to certain exceptions (such as where we are required by law to retain the information).</p>

        <h3>7.5 Objection to Processing</h3>
        <p>You have the right to object to the processing of your personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground.</p>

        <h3>7.6 Withdrawal of Consent</h3>
        <p>If we have collected and process your personal information with your consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</p>

        <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on our website and updating the "Effective Date" at the top of this policy. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
