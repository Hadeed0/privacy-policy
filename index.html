        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Subtitle Learner ("we," "us," or "our") operates Subtitle Learner, which uses WebView to load YouTube and Google Translate. Additionally, our app utilizes speech recognition to convert user speech into text for translation purposes in Google Translate WebView.

This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <h3>1.1 Speech Data</h3>
        <p><strong>Speech Data:</strong> Our app temporarily collects audio data when you use the speech recognition feature. This data is converted into text and used for translation purposes within the app. The audio data is not stored and is discarded after the translation is processed.</p>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>

        <h2>3. How We Share Your Information</h2>
        <h3>3.1 Third-Party Services</h3>

        <p><strong>YouTube:</strong> Our app loads YouTube videos through WebView. YouTube may collect data as described in their privacy policy.</p>
        <p><strong>AdMob:</strong> We use AdMob to display ads in the app. AdMob may collect data such as device information, location data, and app usage data to serve targeted ads and improve their ad campaigns.

        <h3>3.2 Legal Requirements</h3>

        <h3>3.3 Business Transfers</h3>
        <p>We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.</p>

        <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information against unauthorized access, loss, or destruction. However, no security system is impenetrable, and we cannot guarantee the security of our systems 100%.</p>

        <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our app is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under 13, we will take steps to delete such information promptly.</p>
